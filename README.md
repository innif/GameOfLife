### Python-Version of Conway's Game of Life

This project is just another version of Conway's Game of Life, programmed in python 3 using the popular numpy an pygame libraries.

The Goal of this Project is it, to make a nice Game out of cellular automaton developed by the British mathematician John Horton Conway.
If you want to learn more about Conway's Game of Life, visit [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life).

To use this Software, at first you have to install Python 3. It should work with most of the Verision of Python 3, but it's only tested with Python 3.6 and Python 3.7.
You can download Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

After installing Python, you need to add the libraries. To do this, you need to open a terminal and type:
```bash
python3 -m  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

That's it. You can now download the sources and start the game by running main.py.
